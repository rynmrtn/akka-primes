# Task Distribution with Primes

## Problem Statement
Create a Java or Scala program which calculates prime numbers. The program will accept a command line argument N and print all prime numbers from 1 to N. The primes need not be printed in any particular order, but each prime must be printed exactly once.

To distribute this task, research message passing systems in Java or Scala and write a simple system which uses message passing from a dealer to two or more workers in order to calculate the primes. In order to facilitate parallel distribution, use a simple prime number checking algorithm which inspects each integer separately and prints the integer if it is prime.
